Our research demonstrated that small businesses are unable to reach and 
communicate to job seekers in an effective matter. 

Inspired by the “Nudge unit” and rising research in behavioural insights, 
we have developed a simple job description generation tool that connects to existing systems. 
Small business owners/managers can then submit their job requirements into our tool to generate 
the optimal job description and ad for their role.
